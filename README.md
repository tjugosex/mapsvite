### Unfinished map generator using svelte and phaser.   
Run using npm install and then npm run dev.  
Generates and colors a map using a fractal noise map. "Countries" can be made by clicking on the land which then populates the land with a random color.  
Population slows down and speeds up depending on noise elevation to make the countries borders seem more organic
